Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1/1 [==============================] - 1s 1s/step\n","The model predicts that the image contains a African_elephant with confidence 0.5358750224113464\n"]}],"source":["# Pas de ré-entraînement.
